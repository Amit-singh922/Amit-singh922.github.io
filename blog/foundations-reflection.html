    <h1>Foundations Reflections</h1>
    
    <h2>What surprised me the most about learning core is:</h2>
    <p>How much it's reshaped my perspective on problem-solving. Initially, I thought technical skills would be the primary focus, but delving into emotional intelligence and neuroplasticity opened my eyes to the importance of mindset and self-awareness in navigating challenges. I've realized that my ability to adapt and grow isn't limited to technical knowledge but extends to how I approach problems and interact with others. It's a holistic journey that I didn't anticipate but am grateful for.</p>
    
    <h2>Three new things I have learned about myself and my ego due to the core learning:</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>The importance of humility:</strong> Core learning has shown me that being open to feedback and acknowledging my limitations is crucial for growth. My ego sometimes gets in the way, but I'm learning to set it aside and embrace a growth mindset.<br>
        <strong>The role of vulnerability:</strong> I've discovered that vulnerability is not a weakness but a strength. Sharing my struggles and seeking help when needed fosters connection and growth, both personally and professionally.<br>
        <strong>The power of self-reflection:</strong> Core learning has highlighted the significance of introspection in understanding my motivations, biases, and emotions. By reflecting on my experiences, I can identify areas for improvement and cultivate self-awareness.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming:</h2>
    <p>
        Values help in decision-making and guide ethical behavior in both learning and programming. Empathy allows me to understand the perspectives of others, fostering collaboration and effective communication. Self-awareness enables me to recognize my strengths, weaknesses, and emotional triggers, empowering me to navigate challenges and work effectively in teams.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What has surprised me the most about the core learning:</h2>
    <p>The emphasis on personal development and soft skills alongside technical proficiency was unexpected but incredibly valuable. I didn't anticipate how much mindset and emotional intelligence would influence my learning and future career in IT.</p>
    
    <h2>The most challenging aspects of the core learning:</h2>
    <p>Challenging my existing beliefs and habits, especially regarding my ego and mindset, was difficult. It required vulnerability and a willingness to confront discomfort. Additionally, practicing active listening and empathy presented challenges, as it required stepping outside my own perspective and truly understanding others.</p>
    
    <h2>Why a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
    <p>Programming skills are essential, but they're only one aspect of success in the tech industry. I believe employers seek well-rounded individuals who can collaborate, communicate effectively, and adapt to change. By focusing on core learning, the programming school aims to equip students with the foundational skills necessary for long-term success, both personally and professionally. These skills will enhance our abilities to learn and apply technical knowledge, ultimately making us valuable contributors to their teams and the organization as a whole.</p>
    
    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
    <p>No, the time spent studying core learning does not feel like a waste of time. While programming skills are essential, they alone are insufficient for success in the tech industry. Core learning provides a holistic foundation that complements technical proficiency, enhancing problem-solving abilities, communication skills, and emotional intelligence. Investing time in core learning enables me to approach programming with a growth mindset, collaborate effectively with others, and adapt to the evolving demands of the industry. Ultimately, this comprehensive skill set better positions me for long-term success and fulfillment in my career.</p>
