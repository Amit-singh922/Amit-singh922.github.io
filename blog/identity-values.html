    <h2 class="subheading">Ethical Decision-Making</h2>
    <p>One significant ethical decision I faced was during my time working in a fast-paced corporate environment. I encountered a situation where a colleague proposed a shortcut to meet a project deadline that involved compromising on quality and transparency. As I weighed the values of integrity, accountability, and excellence, I realized that sacrificing these principles for short-term gains would ultimately harm our reputation and undermine trust with stakeholders. Despite the pressure, I chose to uphold my values and advocate for a more ethical approach. Looking back, I am proud of my decision as it reinforced my commitment to integrity and strengthened relationships built on trust.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">Cultural Influence</h2>
    <p>Growing up in a close-knit community in India, I was deeply influenced by the values of respect, family, and community. These values have shaped my identity and how I interact with others. They have also influenced my belief in the importance of diversity and inclusion.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">Strengths</h2>
    <p>One of my strengths is my ability to communicate effectively and build strong relationships with others. This has helped me in my career by enabling me to collaborate effectively and resolve conflicts. I believe this strength will support me in my learning journey by facilitating meaningful interactions with peers and mentors.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">Limitations</h2>
    <p>One limitation I have identified is my tendency to be overly self-critical, which can sometimes hinder my confidence. This may affect my learning journey by creating self-doubt. However, I am working on developing a more positive mindset to overcome this limitation.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">Working Productively with Others</h2>
    <p>In a previous team project, I encountered resistance from a team member who was reluctant to collaborate. I tried to address this by actively listening to their concerns and finding common ground. While this approach helped to some extent, I now realize that I could have been more proactive in seeking feedback and involving them in the decision-making process. In future situations, I would prioritize building a stronger rapport from the outset to prevent tension and resistance.</p>
