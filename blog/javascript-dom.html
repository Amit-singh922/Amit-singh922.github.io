    <h1>JS Fundamentals</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h2>
    <p>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS can be compared to the construction of a building. HTML is like the foundation and structure of the building, providing the basic layout and framework. CSS is like the paint and decoration, adding style and visual appeal to the building. JavaScript is like the electrical wiring and plumbing, adding interactivity and functionality to the building. Just as a building needs all these components to be complete and functional, a web page typically needs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to work together seamlessly.</p>

    <h2>2. Explain control flow and loops with an example process from everyday life?</h2>
    <p>Control Flow and Loops Analogy: Let's use the example of cooking dinner. Control flow is like following a recipe step by step. Each step in the recipe represents a statement in JavaScript, and you move from one step to the next based on the outcome of the previous step. Loops are like repetitive tasks in cooking, such as stirring a pot of soup. Instead of stirring manually each time, you use a loop to repeat the stirring process until the soup is ready, saving time and effort.</p>

    <h2>3. What is DOM and an example of how you might interact with it</h2>
    <p>The DOM is like a blueprint of a building, representing the structure and organization of elements on a web page. Just as you can interact with different parts of a building based on its blueprint, you can manipulate and interact with elements on a web page using the DOM. For example, you can use JavaScript to change the text content of a paragraph or modify the styling of a button by accessing and modifying its corresponding DOM element.</p>

    <h2>4. difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
    <p>Arrays and objects are both used to store data, but they have different structures and methods for accessing data. Arrays are ordered lists of values, accessed using numerical indices. For example, myArray[0] would access the first element of the array. Objects, on the other hand, use key-value pairs to store data, and data is accessed using the keys. For example, myObject.key or myObject['key'] would access the value associated with the key 'key' in the object.</p>

    <h2>5. What are functions and why they are helpful</h2>
    <p>Functions in JavaScript are like reusable sets of instructions that perform a specific task. They allow you to encapsulate code into reusable blocks, making it easier to organize and maintain your code. Functions can take input (parameters), perform actions, and return output. For example, you could have a function called calculateArea that takes the length and width of a rectangle as parameters and returns the area of the rectangle. This allows you to easily calculate the area of different rectangles by calling the calculateArea function with different length and width values.</p>
