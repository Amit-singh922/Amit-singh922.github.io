    <h1>Problem-Solving Reflection</h1>

    <h2>1. Blocked on a Simple Problem:</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> On JS Kata challenges i got stuck multiple times figuring out the issue.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem-Solving Techniques Used:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Trying Something:</strong> I experimented with different code snippets to see if any of them would resolve the issue.</li>
        <li><strong>Reading Error Messages:</strong> I carefully read the error messages in the console to understand what went wrong.</li>
        <li><strong>Googling:</strong> I searched online for similar issues and potential solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Asking Peers for Help:</strong> I reached out to my colleagues who might have encountered similar issues before.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Feelings Throughout the Process:</strong> Initially, I felt frustrated and stuck because I couldn't immediately identify the problem. However, as I tried different approaches and sought help from others, I started to feel more hopeful and determined to find a solution.</p>
    <p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> I learned the importance of persistence and not being afraid to seek help when needed. Sometimes, simple problems can become complex if we try to solve them in isolation without leveraging the resources available to us.</p>

    <h2>2. Elegantly Solved a Problem:</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> I needed to optimize a function that was taking too long to execute.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem-Solving Techniques Used:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I outlined the steps of the function in plain language to clarify my approach.</li>
        <li><strong>Trying Something:</strong> I experimented with different algorithms and data structures to see which one would improve the performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Googling:</strong> I researched optimization techniques and best practices for similar problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Asking Coaches for Help:</strong> I consulted with a more experienced developer who provided valuable insights and suggestions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Feelings Throughout the Process:</strong> I felt challenged but motivated to find an elegant solution. Each failed attempt pushed me to think creatively and explore alternative approaches.</p>
    <p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> I learned the importance of systematic problem-solving and seeking guidance from experts when dealing with complex issues. Additionally, I discovered the significance of continuously optimizing code for better performance.</p>

    <h2>3. Reflect on Problem-Solving Techniques:</h2>
    <p>Reflection on confidence levels using various problem-solving techniques:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> Confident</li>
        <li><strong>Trying Something:</strong> Confident</li>
        <li><strong>Rubber Ducky Method:</strong> Not mentioned explicitly</li>
        <li><strong>Reading Error Messages:</strong> Confident</li>
        <li><strong>Console.logging:</strong> Confident</li>
        <li><strong>Googling:</strong> Confident</li>
        <li><strong>Asking Peers for Help:</strong> Confident</li>
        <li><strong>Asking Coaches for Help:</strong> May feel hesitant at times, but recognize the value</li>
        <li><strong>Improving Process with Reflection:</strong> Confident</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Reluctance to Ask for Help:</h2>
    <p>Reflecting on a time when I was reluctant to ask for help:</p>
    <p>There have been times when I hesitated to ask for help because I didn't want to appear incompetent or bother others with my questions. However, I realized that this mindset only hindered my progress and limited my learning opportunities. In the future, I'll prioritize seeking assistance when needed and recognize that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Additionally, I'll strive to create a supportive and collaborative environment where everyone feels comfortable seeking and providing assistance.</p>
