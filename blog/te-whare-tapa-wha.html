    <h2>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h2>
    <p>Regular physical activity not only improves my physical health but also contributes to mental wellbeing by reducing stress and anxiety.</p>
    <p>I go for a run or to the gym regularly to maintain good health.</p>
    

    <h2>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</h2>
    <p>Connecting with family strengthens social bonds and provides a sense of belonging, which is essential for overall wellbeing.</p>
    <p>I call my family at least twice a week to maintain a healthy relationship and support my family where required.</p>
    

    <h2>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h2>
    <p>Meditation helps in calming the mind, reducing stress, and improving focus, thus enhancing emotional and mental wellbeing.</p>
    <p>I do meditation early in the morning or sometimes any other time of the day in a quiet room with no noise.</p>
    

    <h2>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h2>
    <p>Spiritual practices like prayer and gratitude can provide a sense of purpose, meaning, and connectedness, contributing to overall spiritual wellbeing.</p>
    <p>i set aside some time each day for prayer or expressing gratitude to be thankful what I have in my life.</p>
    

    <h2>Whenua (Interconnections to the Land and Environment)</h2>
    <p>Connecting with nature, such as walking barefoot on the beach, has been shown to improve mental and physical wellbeing by reducing stress and increasing feelings of relaxation and happiness.</p>
    <p>I walk barefoot on the beach sometimes I find it very relaxing.</p>

    <p>By incorporating these activities into my routine, I aim to strengthen all aspects of my wellbeing according to the Te Whare Tapa Whā model.</p>
